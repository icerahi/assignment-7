# My Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built with a modern tech stack including Next.js, Express.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. The project is divided into two main parts: a Next.js frontend and an Express.js backend.

## Project Overview

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a monorepo-like structure with two main directories:

-   `./frontend`: Contains the Next.js frontend application.
-   `./backend`: Contains the Express.js backend server.

Each directory has its own detailed `README.md` file with specific setup instructions, tech stack details, and more.

-   **[Frontend README](./frontend/README.md)**
-   **[Backend README](./backend/README.md)**
